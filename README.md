# musefully

## Intro

Powerful platforms like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) make it possible for museums to easily build performant, responsive and accessible faceted searches for their online collections.

Based on [shadcn/next-template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/next-template), which is an implementation of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This project has been deployed on Vercel at [https://musefully.org](https://musefully.org)

## Experimental Features

Similarity based on OpenAI CLIP Embeddings stored in Elasticsearch dense vectors worked very well, but was too costly for the purposes of this project. [See results here.](./docs/EMBEDDINGS.md).

## Lighthouse Score

One should see 100's across the board for the Lighthouse score. Slightly lower score for performance due to relying on external image CDN.
